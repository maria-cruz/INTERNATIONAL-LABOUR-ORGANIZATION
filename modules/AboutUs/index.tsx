                  The project is funded by the ILO and is in collaboration with
                  MoL; a joint effort to empower all stakeholders by providing a
                  solution that promotes awareness on Lebanese Labor Law. The
                  sessions are designed to be accessed in a synchronous mode
                  (live with the trainers) and in an asynchronous mode via a
                  portal where all the sessions are retained along with the
                  activities and assessments in order to ensure a wider target
                  audience and a sustainable, timely access to Labor law
                  training material that is especially designed to effectively
                  impact the stakeholders with reference to the variety of their
                  cultural, educational, and professional background.

                  The training uses the Lebanese Labor Law, its amendments,

                  for curriculum content. However, training activities and
                  assessments are conducted based on research, academic
                  resources and trainerâ€™s experiences.
